Week 7 – Documentation, Final QA, and Handoff Readiness

1. Week Overview
The final week focused on documentation quality, final QA passes, and ensuring the app presents well in both mobile and desktop contexts. I authored a comprehensive README (setup, run, structure, features) and a consolidated 7‑week OJT report. I removed non-essential elements from the mobile header to match the desired product direction, validated the main flows (auth, location prompt, featured brands, brand listing navigation), and tuned responsive spacing and accessibility targets.

2. Objectives and Tasks Completed
- Wrote README with setup steps, tech stack, and common commands.
- Authored OJT_REPORT.md summarizing the 7‑week journey.
- Added a weekly summary table and separate week-by-week detailed reports.
- Removed hamburger/profile icons on mobile header to reduce clutter.
- Ensured consistent typography, spacing, and button sizes (≥44px) across pages.

3. Technical Details
- Docs location: README.md, docs/OJT_REPORT.md, docs/OJT_WEEKLY_TABLE.md, docs/weekly/*.
- Verified core flows: login, location prompt, featured brands, "View All" to /restaurants.
- Checked linting and resolved warnings, e.g., unused imports and naming collisions.

4. Learning Outcomes
- Writing documentation that accelerates onboarding and evaluation.
- Creating QA checklists and validating flows across breakpoints and devices.
- Recognizing the impact of small UX improvements on perceived quality.

5. Challenges Faced and Resolutions
- Keeping documentation current with rapid code changes: locked sections and referenced scripts.
- Preventing regressions during final UI tweaks: tested on mobile/desktop repeatedly.

6. Testing and Validation
- Manual testing across Chrome, Edge, and mobile device emulators.
- Verified no blocking linter errors and ensured successful dev builds.

7. Impact and Future Work
The project is presentation-ready for OJT assessment, featuring a mobile-first UX and a functional backend. Future work should emphasize automated testing, advanced search/filters, caching for performance, and analytics for product insights.
